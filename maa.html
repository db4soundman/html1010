    			<p>After working with Miami All-Access, the university’s sports broadcasting 
    			service, for a year, I saw an opportunity to improve the quality of our 
    			broadcasts in terms of graphics. I took initiative and began designing a 
    			new graphics package, as well as creating a Java program to control it. 
    			This is by far the most complicated project I have worked on, as it 
    			involved GUI components and perusing of Java’s API documentation. This 
    			project took me two weeks to complete, putting in approximately 4 hours 
    			per day on average</p>
    			 
    			 <p>I first began envisioning the graphical aspects of the program and 
    			 created images in Photoshop. Similar to my other projects, I planned out 
    			 the classes that were needed to make this software work. Once the general 
    			 plan was created, I began hard-coding text on some of the graphics as 
    			 placeholders to determine positioning of the text on the graphics. Then, 
    			 the control panel for the software was created, starting with the minimum 
    			 amount of features needed to allow the program to compile and run. Then, 
    			 functionality was added to the software piece by piece until the final 
    			 product was achieved two weeks later. Thorough testing was performed on 
    			 the software to ensure that the program would not crash due to an exception 
    			 or user input.</p>
    			 
    			 <p> There are three different versions of the software (for three 
    			 different sports): Hockey, Basketball, and Baseball. All of these programs 
    			 can import stats files that the widely used Stat Crew software creates, 
    			 which makes stat tracking simple. </p>
