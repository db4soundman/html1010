    		<h6> <img class="StepImg" src= "img/shoppingList.png" /> On Sunday morning, make a list of foods you want to eat for the week and verify  
    		that you have the  ingredients you need to cook the foods.  </h6> 

    		<h6><img class="StepImg" src= "img/cart.png" /> If this is the first time you are implementing this strategy, it is recommended 
    		that you pay attention to which aisles contain which foods, so that future visits to the store will be
more efficient.  </h6>
	
  
    		<h6> <img class="StepImg" src= "img/bagOfood.png" /> Organize the list so that you go through the store in a systematic manner, and 
    		go shopping at the  grocery store.  </h6>
