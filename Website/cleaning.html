    		and a brush. When completed, place everything in the dishwasher.

    			<img class="StepImg" src= "img/startButton.png" /> Before you go shopping on Sunday, run the dishwasher. This again enables 
    		 important multitasking to save you time in your busy schedule.

    			<img class="StepImg" src= "img/checkeredFlag.png" /> When time allows, remove the dishes and silverware from the dishwasher once 
    		the cleaning cycle has completed. This can be done while waiting for food to 
    		cook as well. At this point, you can repeat these three phases, and you will be
    		 on your way to providing your own meals in a small amount of time.
