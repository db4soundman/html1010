    			<p>A homework assignment in the second Java programming class was to 
    			create a console-based quiz that could support a variety of question 
    			types. While working on the homework, I realized that this program could 
    			easily be adapted to a Who Wants to be a Millionaire? program.</p>
    			 
    			 <p>I took the code from the homework assignment and imported it to the 
    			 Processing programming environment. All that was left to do was 
    			 code/create the graphical aspect of the program, including sounds. As 
    			 each new sound and graphical element was added to the program, it was 
    			 tested to make sure that it was triggered at the appropriate time.
    			 </p>
    			 
				<p> It was fairly simple to port over the Java code from Eclipse to the 
				Processing environment, likely because of the class structure used in the 
				original homework assignment. The inheritance used in the class structure
				 kept the code simple to use and easy to modify. When the program was finished,
				it was exported as a standalone application, with screenshots shown to
				the right.
