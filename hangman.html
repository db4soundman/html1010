    			<p>A homework assignment in the second Java programming class was to 
    			create a console-based game of Hangman, where points would be awarded for 
    			guessing a correct letter and having points taken away for guessing an 
    			incorrect letter. While completing the assignment, I realized I could make
    			 a graphical version of this assignment in Processing. </p>
    			  
    			<p>I copied the Java files, created in Eclipse, from the homework assignment and imported them into the Processing environment. 
    			 I then added the graphical components to the Hangman class so that the 
    			 user could tell when they were running out of guesses based on how many 
    			 body parts of the man were hanging from the noose. As I added the 
    			 graphical components I iteratively tested the program to verify that the
    			  graphics accurately represented the gameâ€™s state. </p>
    			  
    			  <p>The most difficult aspect of this project was getting the program to
    			  work in JavaScript mode, which has significant performance bonuses since
    			  Java applets are slowly losing support from Internet browsers. While most
    			  of the code worked right away, the display of guesses was not working 
    			  because JavaScript wanted to represent the letters as their char equivalents.
    			  I finally found a "String.fromCharCode()" method that returned the
    			  actual letter that the user typed, which completed my program. </p>
