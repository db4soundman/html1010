    			<p>In my introduction to software engineering class, we were working on 
    			projects to help the Opening Minds through Art (OMA) program’s art sessions. 
    			In particular, my group was assigned to make an application that would assist
    			 the OMA workers in communicating with its Russian-speaking patrons.</p>
    			 
    			 <p>To do this, we elected to make a website for them to use that contained 
    			 all of the phrases OMA would need to use and the translations. The phrase 
    			 data is stored in an XML file. To ensure the XML file is always formatted 
    			 correctly, I led the production of a Java program that would use the data 
    			 in the XML file and allow the data to be edited or created. To create the 
    			 program, I first created the class structure based on Object Oriented Programming methodology.
    			 I wrote a tester
    			 program that only tried to read in the file to verify that I had my class 
    			 structure set up correctly. Once that test passed, I created each piece 
    			 of the program’s functionality individually and tested that each function 
    			 worked and didn’t encounter any errors. I followed this methodology until 
    			 the entire program was built. Extensive testing was performed to verify 
    			 that the program would not crash on the user.</p>
    			 
    			 <p>JLists proved to be a challenge with this project, as it would originally
    			 produce a small view window to the list of phrases the user could edit, and
    			  the scroll bar was not showing up. I soon realized that I needed to create
    			  a custom ViewPort for the JList with defined dimensions instead of letting
    			  Java calculate the dimensions itself. This solved the problem and produced
    			  the GUI shown to the right.</p>
