    			<p>While preparing for my final exam in my first programming class, I was
    			 skimming through portions of the book that we had not covered out of 
    			 curiosity. I came across a description of a program that involved 
    			 raindrops and a bucket. As soon as I saw those two words, I immediately 
    			 stopped reading the book, and began devising a game centered on catching 
    			 raindrops in a bucket.</p>
    			 
    			 <p>I began planning the general aspects/rules of the game, putting an 
    			 emphasis on making the game easy to understand and fun. I realized there 
    			 needed to be two classes, one for the raindrop, and another for the 
    			 bucket. I used the iterative approach to programming this game. I first 
    			 began designing the raindrop class, particularly because I had to 
    			 experiment with the best way to display a raindrop on the screen. The 
    			 first iteration was to successfully design the raindrop and its 
    			 accompanying class. Similarly, the next iterationâ€™s goal was to design 
    			 the bucket and its class. With both raindrops and a bucket displaying 
    			 correctly on the screen, the game had to be created.</p>
    			 
    			 <p> Similar to the <a href="hangman.html">hangman </a> program, getting the
    			 program to work in JavaScript was causing minor difficulties. In this case,
    			 not all of the raindrops would fall when running in JavaScript mode, yet 
    			 they would all fall when run in Java mode. After posting on Processing's
    			 online forum, a user pointed out that JavaScript does division of ints like
    			 it is done in mathematics instead of the way division is handled in Java.
    			 As a result, all I needed to do was cast the result of the division as an
    			 int and that solved the problem. </p>
